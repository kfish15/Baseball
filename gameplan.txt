action items:
- create README
- finish file for just brewers wild card race




old notes:

- scoreboards.py will work (well) for getting scores. Need to see how live it is by testing when actual games are on



- Need to figure out a way to get standings. Could probably create this on your own by parsing through previous days data, but need to know when to start
		- Search for "MIL" and add to W if win and L if loss
		- Do so for every team, store in dict? Need something to accoutn for mil_wins and mil_losses and group them. Maybe list of dicts? mil would be on dict, chc would be other
		- Need to account for off days, double headers, cancelled games (if result != final)



- Should view getting live results and getting standings as separate issues


- Still don't fully know what output will be, but will potentially be something involving
		- crew, cubs, cards, dbacks, rockies scores
		- standings in some form, probably just related to the brewers
		- could set up that top line automatically to only include relevant teams (based on games we're within for certain spot)

- At the beginning of the day could have something about "this is who plays who at what time and what stadium" for the relevant teams
